      Can you add two time values together? Yes. No. Not so fast!

      Reset your clocks and join me on a graphical tour of time itself.
      You'll discover how "time" is more than a single thing, build intuition around what different operations mean, and get a sense of when some operations are nonsensical.
      You'll leave with a better mental model for thinking about time and avoiding subtle time-related bugs in your own code.

    room: Ballroom C
    description: >-
      What should a developer do if suddenly one day they get assigned to debug a Sev1 performance issue?

      From our experience, sometimes finding the problem itself is very difficult and thus takes a lot of time.
      In this talk we will talk about some profilers which one can use to get visibility into what’s happening while executing code.
      These profilers may not always give us the exact root-cause but will always be able to give us directions to debug further.

      To also make things more relatable, as a case-study, we would be using a real problem which our team dealt with recently while upgrading the Ruby version of one of the largest monolith Rails application.

      Ever wondered why a line of Ruby code with no side effects has no performance impact?
      This talk will explain the concept of "popped" instruction sequences, demystifying how CRuby works behind the scenes to avoid running unnecessary code.
      We'll delve into parsing, compiling, abstract syntax trees, and instruction sequence.
      You’ll leave this talk with a deeper understanding of Ruby's inner workings and why they matter.

      Imagine you receive a CSV of data that has over 500,000 rows and 100 columns.
      Data is randomly missing in some places, some of the column names are wrong, and you have mixed Data types in some of the columns.
      Correcting and cleaning that data by hand could take hours.
      Fear not! There is a better and faster way.
      We will look into using Ruby Polars, a gem written in Rust with a Ruby API, to wrangle and clean tabular data to get it prod ready.
      By learning some basic operations used in Polars you can greatly expedite the import process of CSV files and API Data.
      Whether your goal is to use the Data in an existing application or use it in a Ruby AI/Machine learning project(since cleaning Data is a vital first step in this process), this talk will get you well on your way!

    room: Ballroom A
    description: >-
      A talk about turning data into other data. Not particularly useful data, but imagine if you could listen to a jpeg, or see what an executable file looked like, or turn a zip file into an orchestral score?

      Some time ago I stumbled across the header description for WAV files and wondered: what if I took a file and calculated the appropriate WAV file header for it, could I hear my data? Turns out, yes, you can.
      You probably don’t want to, but you can! In this talk we’ll explore how it works for WAV files, BMP files and MIDI files.
      Along the way we’ll learn a lot about using ruby to manipulate raw bytes and bits of data, but also we’ll hear a README file, view an executable, and listen to the ruby interpreter itself!

      For decades, the Ruby community has been fractured in the way that it parses and understands Ruby code.
      After countless tools have been developed and person-hours have been invested, we still don't have a common language for understanding Ruby code.
      No longer! Starting in Ruby 3.3, we will have a single API for parsing and understanding Ruby code.
      This talk will cover the history of how we got here, what is getting built today, and what you can expect from this exciting future.

    description: >-
      A Ruby application is built on a foundation of its gems.
      But how does a gem get from the package repository to running in your project?
      RubyGems and Bundler does an excellent job in removing the complexities of gem resolution and installation so developers can focus on building great software.
      Let’s do a deep dive on how these tools seamlessly manage the dependencies you need to get your project off the ground!

      In this talk, we’ll be taking a look at the inner workings of the Ruby package ecosystem.
      This includes:
        - The processes involved in installing gems from a Gemfile
        - Insights into debugging gems within a Rails application
        - Ensuring you're selecting the right gems to avoid security risks

      Delve into object-oriented programming and bring the Enigma machine back to life with an emulator built in Ruby.
      Unravel the secrets of this nigh-unbreakable cipher device, witness OO principles unlock its mysteries, discover the power and versatility of the patterns we use as developers and how they mirror the Enigma's inner workings.

      Historically, calling a method with a very large number of arguments resulted in a core dump.
      In Ruby 1.9, this was improved to instead raise SystemStackError.
      In Ruby 2.2, the issue was fixed for methods defined in Ruby.
      However, in Ruby 3.2, this is still an issue for methods defined in C.
      This issue was reported as a bug over 12 years ago, and was the second oldest open bug in Ruby's bug tracker.
      Come learn about stacks, heaps, argument handling during method dispatch, and how we fixed this bug in Ruby 3.3.

    description: >-
      Ruby is slow. Despite improvements over the years, the language will never be as fast as a compiled language.
      To compensate for this, whenever Ruby developers need to run performance critical code, it's not uncommon for them to interoperate with a library written in C.
      Dozens of well known gems, such as Nokogiri and Bcrypt, already do this.
      But with C comes other problems: how can we ensure that our low-level code is safe from memory leaks and other security vulnerabilities?
      In this talk, I'll introduce the oxidize-rb project, which is a suite of open source tools which makes it possible to call Rust libraries from within Ruby.
      I'll also demonstrate how simple it is to incorporate Rust code (including Cargo dependencies) into a Ruby gem.

      Let’s just say I was well into the “shame on me” part of that relationship, until I discovered the secret ingredient that nearly all flaky tests have in common.

      In 1994, Stewart Brand published a book called "How Buildings Learn, and What Happens After They're Built".
      As well as a fascinating account of architecture and the history of various buildings and building styles, some ideas from this book were inspirational to the famous "Big Ball of Mud" paper, by Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder.

      Can we learn anything about building software systems from the observations in Brand's book and the Big Ball of Mud paper? Spoiler alert: yes, I think so! Let's talk about them.

      You’ve heard of tools like OpenAI and ChatGPT, but how can they be useful in practice?
      In this workshop we’ll walk through making a simple Ruby program to suggest conference talks for you to attend in the coming days based on your interests.
      In the process, you’ll gain the skills to implement similarity searches in other data sets and familiarity with some Ruby-based tools to use with LLMs.
      Give your future self the gift of a great conference schedule by signing up for this workshop!
      No prior experience with AI needed, as long as you know basic Ruby syntax we’ll take it from there.

      How do you know if your software is good?
      I’m being deliberately vague.
      “Good” can mean “well-written,” “performant,” or “has lots of test coverage.”
      Maybe your product has a “good user experience,” or is “genuinely helpful to your CX team.”
      Or maybe it means that it’s actually doing meaningful things for the world.
      I’ll teach you how to figure out how “good” your stuff is by identifying the types of users who will be affected by it and how they will be affected.
      By the end of this workshop, you’ll know how to figure out if your software is “good,” how to make it better, and how to convince your team to join you.

  - title: Ruby coding with RBS and Steep

    room: Ballroom C
    description: >-
      In this workshop we will learn Ruby coding assisted by RBS-based type checking tools.
      Start with running the type checker to detect bugs and reading the code base with the help of the editor integration.
      Try the exercises to implement new features -- designing the API by writing RBS type definitions and coding with rich editor assistance.

      We will provide a sample application, exercises, and devcontainer setup.
      Type checker setup and RBS type definitions are included.
      Just start your editor to try type based development experience.
